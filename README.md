# RTD
Runtime Dispatcher

Sub engine for scenes in different time of game, inspired by RTOs from Vangers source code.
For example you can create RTOs "MainMenuRTO" and "ActionRTO", and at start of game player will be in the menu, and after play button will be pressed
current RTO will change from main menu to action RTO.
